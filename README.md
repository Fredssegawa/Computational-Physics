## Projects
This section showcases some of the projects that are part of this repository:
1. Global Climate Model (GCM) Simplified Simulation
Description: In this project, students will create a simplified version of a Global Climate Model (GCM). They will simulate basic components of Earth's climate system, such as radiation balance, atmospheric circulation, and ocean currents. This project will introduce students to the complexities of climate modeling and the importance of computational methods in predicting climate change.
2. Modeling the Greenhouse Effect
Description: In this project, students will simulate the greenhouse effect by modeling how different gases in the atmosphere trap heat. They will explore how varying concentrations of greenhouse gases affect Earthâ€™s temperature and contribute to global warming.
