## COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS?
Computational physics is the implementation of numerical analysis
to solve problems in physics. It requires integration of Physics with Computer Science
Mathemathics.

- The first application of modern computers in science was via computational physics.
- Computational Physics is NOW a subset of Computational Sciences
- It forms the basis for Computer Simulations in Physics, however with itâ€™s
  applications extending beyond Simulations.

# Background Knowledge:
- Root Finding (using e.g. Newton-Raphson Method)
- Systems of Linear Equations (using e.g. LU decomposition)
- ODE (using e.g. Runge-Kutta Methods)
- Integration (using e.g. Monte Carlo Integration)
- PDE (using e.g. Finite Difference Method)
- Matrix Manipulation
